BLB - Berean Literal Bible
The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham:
Abraham begat Isaac, and Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob begat Judah and his brothers.
And Judah begat Perez and Zerah out of Tamar, and Perez begat Hezron, and Hezron begat Ram.
and Jesse begat David the king. Next: David begat Solomon, out of the wife of Uriah,
And Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, the One being called Christ.
So all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations, and from David until the carrying away to Babylon fourteen generations, and from the carrying away to Babylon to the Christ fourteen generations.
